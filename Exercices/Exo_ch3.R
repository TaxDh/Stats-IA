#3.7.2, 3.7.3, 3.7.4
#Question 1
#Describe the null hypotheses to which the p-values given in 
#Table 3.4 correspond. Explain what conclusions you can draw 
#based on these p-values. Your explanation should be phrased 
#in terms of sales, TV, radio, and newspaper, rather than in 
#terms of the coefficients of the linear model.

#For intercept, that β0=0, For the others, that βn=0
#(for n=1,2,3) We can conclude that that without any spending, 
#there are still some sales (the intercept is not 0). 
#Furthermore, we can conclude that money spent on TV and radio  
#are significantly associated with increased sales, but the same 
#cannot be said of newspaper spending.
